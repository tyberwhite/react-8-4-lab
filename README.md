1. Research documentation of SWAPI to find the endpoint for the starshipsresource.

2. Create a services/sw-api.jsservice module and ensure that all API/fetch calls are made from this module.

3. Use named exports to expose AJAX functionality as needed, e.g., export function getAllStarships() {...}to obtain all starships.

4. Obtain all of the starships from the API and render in <App> a card for each starship.

5. Cards should contain the text of the starship's name.
